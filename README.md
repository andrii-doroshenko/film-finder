# Movie Search Application
Repository is a movie search and storage
application. It implements basic routing using React Router.

The application uses the themoviedb.org API to retrieve movie data. To work with
the API, you need to register and obtain an API key.

The project includes the following features:

The home page displays a list of the most popular movies for today. On the
movies search page, users can search for movies based on keywords. The movie
details page shows comprehensive information about a specific movie, including
the cast and reviews. The project consists of multiple components, each located
in a separate folder containing a React component file and a styles file. The
components also define propTypes to describe the expected props.

The code in the project is clean and readable, and Prettier is used for code
formatting. Styling is implemented using CSS modules or Styled Components.

Additionally, the project utilizes code splitting using React.lazy() and
<Suspense>. This allows for asynchronous loading of JavaScript code for each
route, improving the application's performance.
